# belly-button-challenge

In this challenge I will be creating an interactive dashboard of the Biodiversty dataset to catalogs the microbs that colonize human navals. In this project I will be creating various charts to display the data given to me. 

The site has the following elements:

- A test subject drop-down menu that is dynamically populated based upon the sample data
- A panel and three graphs are dynamically created based upon the subject selected:
- A Demographic Panel that lists the subject's information
- A Bar Graph that illustrates the ten most prevalent OTU's found for this subject
- A Bubble Graph that illustrates the OTUs and their relative sample values
- A Gauge that shows the washing frequency

  You can find this dashboard here:
